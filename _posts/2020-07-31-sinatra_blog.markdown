The Sinatra section started out rough for me, First we started with SQL which was a bit complicated and confusing but then got much easier as we moved into active record. Which is a life saver, only having to know the basic ruby functions of active record compared to having to look up all the syntax of SQL every time. Plus it looks much nicer and neater having all your code in ruby rather than string interpolation of SQL. After we moved from Active record and SQL we hopped into Sinatra its self which is a great way of having ruby inside of our html. It makes having dynamic html elements really easy since you can iterate trough all your html per a ruby item. Rather then just having raw html which would have to be static and know all the items being put in it before hand. In the end active record makes SQL easier and Sinatra makes our pages much more useful.

I've always been into tech and computers from when I was young. I started with video games and slowly over time I began a interest into how they worked and what happened in the backend. I started making scripts and messing with video games and their mechanics. In highschool I took an intro our Into Computer Science class I really enjoyed it and decided that would be the degree I would pursue into college. After burning a hole in my pocket going to college for a year and a half I found out about boot camps and with already not liking the tediousness and what I felt like was learning a lot of things that where useless and I was never going to use I chose to put college on the back-burner and try boot camps which seemed like a much smarter and more reasonable option. In short that's how I ended up here.
